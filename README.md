# Refactored_Robot_Test

This was originally part of a technical test assigned during a recruitment process. The challenge was this:

```
A robot moves according to the following instructions:
 
 F = move one unit forward
 L = rotate 90 degrees anticlockwise
 R = rotate 90 degree clockwise

 With an input of instructions (eg. 'LFRRFLLLF') calculate and return the minimum number of instructions
 needed to return the robot to its starting point. The output should be an integer. Any other characters
 in the intructions should be ignored.
```

The instructions were to produce working code quickly, rather than elegant or efficient code. 

I produced a solution (robotOriginalCode.py) which passed 100% of the tests, but it is long-winded and ugly. 

My original code has no in-build tests and needs refactoring, so I'm using it as a litle project to 
help me practice refactoring and to explore writing code using Test Driven Development (TDD) principles.
